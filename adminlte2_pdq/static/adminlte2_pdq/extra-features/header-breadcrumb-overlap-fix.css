/**
 * When the Page Header (block "page_name") value is long, it can sometimes overlap with the page breadcrumbs.
 * This appears to be an issue with original AdminLTE2, but is still probably undesired behavior.
 *
 * Some element styles are defined via :before tags, which aren't directly part of the DOM and thus cannot be
 * changed with JS. See things like https://stackoverflow.com/a/17789110 for more info.
 *
 * Thus, this file gets around it by adding CSS classes.
