class AuthMiddleware:
    """
    Middleware that requires a user to be authenticated to view any page other
    than ones defined in LOGIN_EXEMPT_ENDPOINTS.
    Exemptions to this requirement can optionally be specified with the
    ADMINLTE2_LOGIN_EXEMPT_WHITELIST setting in your settings.py file.
    (which you can copy from your urls.py).
    If a user tries to access one of these routes, they will be redirected to
    the LOGIN_URL defined in settings.

    Additionally, if the ADMINLTE2_USE_STRICT_POLICY setting is enabled,
    users will be prevented from accessing a route if the view for that route
    does not have permissions or login_required defined on that view.
    If a user tries to access one of these routes, they will be redirected to
    the ADMINLTE2_HOME_ROUTE defined in settings which is the only
    non-login required route that is exempt by default.
    If you would like to add additional exempt routes, you can add them to the
    ADMINLTE2_STRICT_POLICY_WHITELIST setting in your settings.py file.

    Requires authentication middleware and template context processors to be
    loaded. You'll get an error if they aren't.
