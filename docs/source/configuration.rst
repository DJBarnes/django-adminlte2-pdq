Configuration
*************

There are various configuration options that can be set via Django Settings to
control the overall look, feel, and functionality of the package.
All settings are listed here for reference even though some of these settings
such as the :doc:`menu` and :doc:`authorization` can become quite complex and
have dedicated documentation pages to better explain the full extent of these
settings.

Home Configuration
==================

ADMINLTE2_HOME_ROUTE
--------------------

Set the "Home" route for you project so that the package knows
where to redirect users when they click a link that is designed
to take the user home.

:Type: ``string``
:Default: ``django_adminlte_2:home``

Example::

    ADMINLTE2_HOME_ROUTE = 'django_adminlte_2:home'


Menu Configuration
==================

ADMINLTE2_INCLUDE_MAIN_NAV_ON_ADMIN_PAGES
-----------------------------------------

By default the main navigation (non-admin) is not part of the sidebar when the
user is viewing an admin page. If you would like users to be able to see all of
the main nav links regardless of what page they are on, set this setting to
``True``.

:Type: ``bool``
:Default: ``False``

Example::

    ADMINLTE2_INCLUDE_MAIN_NAV_ON_ADMIN_PAGES = {True|False}


ADMINLTE2_INCLUDE_ADMIN_NAV_ON_MAIN_PAGES
-----------------------------------------

By default, admin navigation is not part of the sidebar when the user is
viewing a main navigation (non-admin) page. If you would like users to be able
to see all of the admin nav links regardless of what page they are on, set this
setting to ``True``.

.. note::

    Visibility is stil subject to a user having the ``is_staff`` property.
    Without that property, the admin section of the sidebar will still be
    hidden to the user regardless of this setting.

:Type: ``bool``
:Default: ``False``

Example::

    ADMINLTE2_INCLUDE_ADMIN_NAV_ON_MAIN_PAGES = {True|False}


ADMINLTE2_USE_MENU_GROUP_SEPARATOR
----------------------------------

By default there will be a implicit separator bar rendered between each menu
group.
These groups include: **MENU_FIRST**, **MENU**, **MENU_LAST**, and the
**Admin Menu**.
More information about these groups can be found on the :doc:`menu` page.
If you would like to disable this separator from being automatically rendered
set this setting to ``False``.


:Type: ``bool``
:Default: ``True``

Example::

    ADMINLTE2_USE_MENU_GROUP_SEPARATOR = {True|False}


ADMINLTE2_MENU
--------------

This setting is the definition for the main navigation menu.
There are a lot of options when creating this menu.
See the :doc:`menu` section for a detailed explanation on how to create this
menu and all of the available options that can be used.

:Type: ``list``
:Default: ``[]``

Example::

    ADMINLTE2_MENU = []


Admin Configuration
===================

.. note::

    All of the settings in this section work directly with the sidebar and
    the sidebar links inside the admin section of the sidebar. By default,
    the admin sidebar section is only shown on admin pages. If you would like
    to change this behavior so that the admin sidebar section is available on
    all pages, please see the :ref:`configuration:ADMINLTE2_INCLUDE_ADMIN_NAV_ON_MAIN_PAGES`
    section for more information.


ADMINLTE2_INCLUDE_ADMIN_HOME_LINK
---------------------------------

By default the site sidebar will not have a link to the admin index page.
If you would like to see a link to the admin index page in the sidebar set this
setting to ``True``.

.. note::

    This link is in essence another Admin link and as such will be treated like
    all other admin links. If you do not see this link in your sidebar after
    enabling, please refer to the
    :ref:`configuration:ADMINLTE2_INCLUDE_ADMIN_NAV_ON_MAIN_PAGES`
    setting for more information.

:Type: ``bool``
:Default: ``False``

Example::

    ADMINLTE2_INCLUDE_ADMIN_HOME_LINK = {True|False}


ADMINLTE2_ADMIN_INDEX_USE_APP_LIST
----------------------------------

By default Django-AdminLTE-2 will put the Apps on the Admin Index page
into AdminLTE Info Boxes. Setting this to ``True`` will change that look
to the traditional Django list view but still within the main adminlte site
styling.

.. note::

    If you do not see a link for the admin index page in the sidebar, please
    refer to the :ref:`configuration:ADMINLTE2_INCLUDE_ADMIN_HOME_LINK`
    setting for information on how to enable it.

:Type: ``bool``
:Default: ``False``

Example::

    ADMINLTE2_ADMIN_INDEX_USE_APP_LIST = {True|False}


ADMINLTE2_ADMIN_MENU_IN_TREE
----------------------------

By default the sidebar will render a root entry for each app in the project.
Each app entry will be a tree that can be collapsed and expanded to reveal
entries for the models in that app. If you would like to put the entire admin
sidebar section also into a tree so that not only can apps be collapsed and
expanded out, but also the entire admin section can be collapsed and expanded
out, set this setting to ``True``.

.. note::

    You can refer to the :ref:`menu:tree` section of the :doc:`menu` page for more
    information about how trees work and are defined manually.

:Type: ``bool``
:Default: ``False``

Example::

    ADMINLTE2_ADMIN_MENU_IN_TREE = {True|False}


Authorization Configuration
===========================

ADMINLTE2_USE_WHITELIST_FOR_UNDEFINED_PERMISSIONS
-------------------------------------------------

Whether routes with no defined permission should be hidden unless added to a
Whitelist

If this setting is set to False, then all routes without a defined permission
are still visible on the sidebar menu

If this setting is set to True, then all routes without a defined permission
are hidden on the sidebar menu unless the route is found in the
``ADMINLTE2_MENU_PERMISSION_FREE_WHITELIST`` setting.

:Type: ``bool``
:Default: ``False``

Example::

    ADMINLTE2_USE_WHITELIST_FOR_UNDEFINED_PERMISSIONS = {True|False}


ADMINLTE2_MENU_PERMISSION_FREE_WHITELIST
----------------------------------------

Assuming ``ADMINLTE2_USE_WHITELIST_FOR_UNDEFINED_PERMISSIONS`` is set to True,
this is the list of routes that will be shown on the sidebar menu and
accessible
despite a defined permission.

:Type: ``list``
:Default: ``[]``

Example::

    ADMINLTE2_MENU_PERMISSION_FREE_WHITELIST = []
