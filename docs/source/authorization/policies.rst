Access Policy
*************


Setting up authorization for the sidebar menu and its associated links requires
choosing a policy (see below), and then properly using some
:ref:`authorization/function_views:Decorators` or
:ref:`authorization/class_views:Mixins` provided by this package to set
permissions on various views. Setting the permissions on the view has the added
benefit of not only preventing users from accessing a view, but also
automatically hiding links on the sidebar menu from the users
that do not have access.


Setup
=====

The first step in using and configuring authorization for views and sidebar
menu links is to determine what general policy you want to adhere to.
Your choices are:

1. :ref:`authorization/policies:Loose Policy` - By default all sidebar links are
   visible and accessible to the user.

   * Majority of sidebar links are visible to all users.
   * Link will still be visible if you set a permission on that route's view
     and that user has the correct permission.
   * Link will be hidden if you set a permission on that route's view and the
     user does not have the correct permission.


2. :ref:`authorization/policies:Strict Policy` - By default all sidebar links
   are hidden from the user.

   * Majority of sidebar links are hidden to all users.
   * Link will become visible if you set a permission on that route's view
     and that user has the correct permission.
   * Link will become visible if you put the route in an explicit whitelist
     defined in the settings.

   .. important::

       The strictness in this policy is related to the visibility of sidebar
       menu links only. If no permissions are set on a corresponding view,
       the sidebar menu link is not visible, but the user can still technically
       gain access to the page assuming that they know the url and directly
       go to it. To completely block users from a route, you **Must** define
       a permission on the view or handle it with some other form of permission
       checking provided by Django.

Once you have determined what general policy you want to follow, use
the corresponding section to properly set up and configure authorization.


Loose Policy
============

Use the following steps to finish out your policy.
Refer to the :doc:`../configuration/authorization` section for information about
the specific settings in settings.py mentioned below.

1. Ensure that the ``ADMINLTE2_USE_STRICT_POLICY``
   is either not defined in ``settings.py``, or is set to ``False`` if it is
   defined.

2. If you are using function based views, read the :doc:`function_views`
   page and follow the steps in the
   ref:`authorization/function_views:Loose Decorator Example` section to
   add permissions to views that require permission to access.

4. If you are using class based views, read the :doc:`class_views` page
   and follow the steps in the
   :ref:`authorization/class_views:Loose Mixin Example` section to add
   permissions to views that require permission to access.


Strict Policy
=============

Use the following steps to finish out your policy.
Refer to the :doc:`../configuration/authorization` section for information about
the specific settings in settings.py mentioned below.

1. Ensure that the ``ADMINLTE2_USE_STRICT_POLICY``
   is defined in ``settings.py`` and is set to ``True``.

2. If you are using function based views, read the :doc:`function_views`
   page and follow the steps in the
   :ref:`authorization/function_views:Strict Decorator Example` section
   to add permissions to views that require permission to access.

3. If you are using class based views, read the :doc:`class_views` page
   and follow the steps in the
   :ref:`authorization/class_views:Strict Mixin Example` section to add
   permissions to views that require permission to access.

4. Add any routes that do not require a specific permission and should
   be available to everyone to the ``ADMINLTE2_STRICT_POLICY_WHITELIST``
   in ``settings.py``
