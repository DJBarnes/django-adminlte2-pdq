Authorization
=============

Setting up authorization for the sidebar and its associated links requires
choosing a Policy_ and then properly using some provided Decorators_ to set
permissions on various views.

Policy
------

There area a few options that can be used to control whether or not a
user can see and has access to routes defined on the sidebar.
The first step in using and configuring this correctly is to determine
what general policy you want to adhere to. Your choices are:

1. Loose Policy - By default all sidebar nodes are visible and accessible to
   the user.

   * Majority of sidebar nodes are visible and accessible to all users
   * Node will still be visible if you set a permission on that route's view
     and that user has the correct permission
   * Node will be hidden if you set a permission on that route's view and the
     user does not have permission


2. Strict Policy - By default all sidebar nodes are hidden and inaccessible to
   the user.

   * Majority of sidebar nodes are hidden and inaccessible to all users
   * Node will still be visible if you set a permission on that route's view
     and that user has the correct permission
   * Node will still be visible if put the route in an explicit whitelist

Once you have determined what general policy you want to follow, use
the following sections to properly set up and configure authorization.

Loose Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the following steps to finish out your policy.
Refer to the :doc:`configuration` section for information about the specific
settings in settings.py.

1. Ensure that the ``ADMINLTE2_USE_WHITELIST_FOR_UNDEFINED_PERMISSIONS``
   is either not defined in settings.py, or if it is, it is set to ``False``.

2. Follow the steps in the BLAHBLAH section to add permissions to the
   views that require permission to access.

Strict Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the following steps to finish out your policy.
Refer to the :doc:`configuration` section for information about the specific
settings in settings.py.

1. Ensure that the ``ADMINLTE2_USE_WHITELIST_FOR_UNDEFINED_PERMISSIONS``
   is defined in settings.py and is set to ``True``.

2. Follow the steps in the BLAHBLAH section to add permissions to the
   views that require permission to access.

3. Add any routes that do not require a specific permission and should
   be available to everyone to the ``ADMINLTE2_MENU_PERMISSION_FREE_WHITELIST``
   in settings.py

Decorators
----------

There are two decorators that can be used on a view to control whether a
user has access to both the view, and the visibility of any nodes in the
sidebar that link to that view.

Requires All permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``@requires_all_permissions``

This decorator will list all required permissions for the view. It uses
Django's default permission checking to know whether to show the view to
the user, but also adds the required property to the view so that the
permissions are required to see the equivalent node on the sidebar.


Requires One Permission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``@requires_one_permission``

This decorator will list the permissions that a user must have at least one
of in order to access the view and see the associated sidebar node.
