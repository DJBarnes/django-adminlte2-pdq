Authorization
*************

Setting up authorization for the sidebar and its associated links requires
choosing a Policy_ and then properly using some provided Decorators_ or Mixins_
to set permissions on various views.

Policy
======

There area a few options that can be used to control whether or not a
user can see and has access to routes defined on the sidebar.
The first step in using and configuring this correctly is to determine
what general policy you want to adhere to. Your choices are:

1. `Loose Policy`_ - By default all sidebar nodes are visible and accessible to
   the user.

   * Majority of sidebar nodes are visible and accessible to all users
   * Node will still be visible if you set a permission on that route's view
     and that user has the correct permission
   * Node will be hidden if you set a permission on that route's view and the
     user does not have permission


2. `Strict Policy`_ - By default all sidebar nodes are hidden and inaccessible to
   the user.

   * Majority of sidebar nodes are hidden and inaccessible to all users
   * Node will become visible if you set a permission on that route's view
     and that user has the correct permission
   * Node will become visible if you put the route in an explicit whitelist
     defined in the settings.

Once you have determined what general policy you want to follow, use
the following sections to properly set up and configure authorization.

Loose Policy
------------

Use the following steps to finish out your policy.
Refer to the :doc:`configuration` section for information about the specific
settings in settings.py mentioned below.

1. Ensure that the ``ADMINLTE2_USE_WHITELIST_FOR_UNDEFINED_PERMISSIONS``
   is either not defined in ``settings.py``, or set to ``False`` if it is.

2. If you are using function based views, follow the steps in the
   `Loose Decorator Example`_ section to add permissions to views that require
   permission to access.

3. If you are using class based views, follow the steps in the
   `Loose Mixin Example`_ section to add permissions to views that require
   permission to access.

Strict Policy
-------------

Use the following steps to finish out your policy.
Refer to the :doc:`configuration` section for information about the specific
settings in settings.py mentioned below.

1. Ensure that the ``ADMINLTE2_USE_WHITELIST_FOR_UNDEFINED_PERMISSIONS``
   is defined in ``settings.py`` and is set to ``True``.

2. If you are using function based views, follow the steps in the
   `Strict Decorator Example`_ section to add permissions to views that require
   permission to access.

3. If you are using class based views, follow the steps in the
   `Strict Mixin Example`_ section to add permissions to views that require
   permission to access.

4. Add any routes that do not require a specific permission and should
   be available to everyone to the ``ADMINLTE2_MENU_PERMISSION_FREE_WHITELIST``
   in ``settings.py``

Function based views
====================

Decorators
----------

There are three decorators that can be used on a view to control whether a
user has access to both the view, and the visibility of any nodes in the
sidebar that link to that view.

Login Required
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``@login_required``

This decorator will enforce that a user is logged into the system before they
can access the view. Django's default login_required decorator is used behind
the scenes and is only recreated in this package in order to add the magic of
automatic sidebar node rendering.

When using this decorator on a function view, if the user in not logged in,
the user will not be able to access this View nor will they see a sidebar menu
entry that maps to this View. However, if the user is logged in,
they will see the sidebar link and have access.

.. code:: python

    @login_required
    def demo_css(request):
        """Show examples of extra-features.css"""
        return render(request, 'adminlte2/demo_css.html', {
            'bootstrap_types': ['primary'],
        })

Requires All permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``@requires_all_permissions``

This decorator will list all required permissions for the view. It uses
Django's default permission checking to know whether to show the view to
the user, but also adds the required property to the view so that the
permissions are required to see the equivalent node on the sidebar.

When using this decorator on a function view, if the user does not have all of
the permissions that we define in this decorator, the user will not be able to
access this View nor will they see a sidebar menu entry that maps to this View.
However, if the user does have all of these permissions, they will see the
sidebar link and have access.

.. code:: python

    @requires_all_permissions([
        'auth.add_group',
        'auth.change_group',
        'auth.delete_group'
    ])
    def sample1(request):
        """Show default sample1 page"""
        return render(request, 'adminlte2/sample1.html', {})


Requires One Permission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``@requires_one_permission``

This decorator will list the permissions that a user must have at least one
of in order to access the view and see the associated sidebar node.

When using this decorator on a function view, if the user does not have at
least one of the permissions that we define on this decorator, the user will
not be able to access this View nor will they see a sidebar menu entry that
maps to this View. However, if the user has at least one of any of these
permissions, they will see the sidebar link and have access.

.. code:: python

    @requires_one_permission([
        'auth.add_permission',
        'auth.change_permission',
        'auth.delete_permission'
    ])
    def sample2(request):
        """Show default sample2 page"""
        return render(request, 'adminlte2/sample2.html', {})

Decorator Examples
------------------

Loose Decorator Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example there are four routes, views, and sidebar entries.
Home should be shown to all users regardless of being logged in or having
permission.
Sample 1 requires two permissions (and thus being logged in) to see and access.
Sample 2 should require at least one permission (and being logged in) to see
and access. But, we intentionally forgot to add that permission to demonstrate
what will happen.
Demo CSS requires simply being logged in to see and access.

.. note::

    In the below files, we have purposely made a mistake in regards to the
    Sample2 view in order to no only demonstrate how the various files and
    contents work, but also to show what sort of side effects to expect when
    using the Loose Policy. Below this initial attempt and results. Below that
    we correct our initial mistake and show the proper configuration as well as
    what users will see.

Class based views
====================

Mixins
------

There are two mixins that can be used on a class based view to control whether
a user has access to both the view, and the visibility of any nodes in the
sidebar that link to that view.

Login Required
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``LoginRequiredMixin``

This mixin will enforce that a user is logged into the system before they
can access the view. Django's default LoginRequiredMixin is used behind the
scenes and is only recreated in this package in order to add the magic of
automatic sidebar node rendering.

When using this mixin on a class based view, if the user in not logged in,
the user will not be able to access this View nor will they see a sidebar menu
entry that maps to this View. However, if the user is logged in,
they will see the sidebar link and have access to the view.

.. code:: python

    class DemoCss(LoginRequiredMixin, View):
        """Show examples of extra-features.css"""
        def get(request):
            return render(request, 'adminlte2/demo_css.html', {
                'bootstrap_types': ['primary'],
            })

Permission Required
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``PermissionRequiredMixin``

This mixin will list all permissions for the view that a user must either have
all of, or at least one of in order to be able to see the view in the sidebar
and have access to it. It uses Django's default permission checking to
know whether to show the view to the user, but also adds the required property
to the view so that the permissions are required to see the equivalent node on
the sidebar.

You are required to set a different class level attribute depending on whether
you want all permissions required, or one of a list of permissions required.

.. warning::

    We wanted to prevent the Sample2 view from being accessed by people that
    do not have at least one permission, but forgot to add that to our view.
    Because we are using a Loose policy, everyone can see and have access this
    view. This is the "loose" part of the loose policy as it defaults to
    everyone being able to see every view unless a permission is explicitly
    set on that view to add security.

    Let's fix our mistake so that Sample2 is protected and see the difference.

Strict Mixin Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example there are four routes, views, and sidebar entries.
Home should be shown to all users regardless of being logged in or having
permission but we intentionally forgot to add that view's route to a whitelist
in order to demonstrate what will happen.
Sample 1 requires two permissions (and thus being logged in) to see and access.
Sample 2 should require at least one permission (and being logged in) to see
and access but we intentionally forgot to add that permission to demonstrate
what will happen.
Demo CSS requires simply being logged in to see and access.

.. note::

    In the below files, we have purposely made a mistake in regards to the
    Home and Sample2 views in order to no only demonstrate how the various
    files and contents work, but also to show what sort of side effects to
    expect when using the Strict Policy. Below this initial attempt we correct
    our mistake and show the proper configuration as well as what users will
    see.

    permission free whitelist so that everyone will have access to it. In the
    case of Sample2, we are going to add the missing permissions that we
