Templates
*********

General
=======

This package comes with a lot of templates that are used right out of the box.
Any and all of these templates can be overridden to customize the look and feel
of the site. Rather than listing out every single file and every single block
within those files that can overridden, it is preferable that you just
reference the files yourself to see what can be overridden. The files can be

For a sample change, see the below instructions.
