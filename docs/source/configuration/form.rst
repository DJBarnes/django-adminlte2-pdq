Form and Field Configuration
============================

ADMINLTE2_DATETIME_WIDGET
-------------------------

Set the DateTime widget to use with rendering out a DateTime form field.
By default, this will be ``native`` which will just use the HTML5 native widgets.
Additionally, you can use ``jquery`` to use the JS jquery-datetimepicker.js library.

.. note::

    This setting only affects how the form field is rendered out.
    For ``native`` this means changing the input type to ``datetime-local``.
    For the other option, this means keeping its type ``text`` but adding an
    icon to indicate that it should be a datetime field.
    Aside from loading the needed JS library, it does not add any additional JS
    to make the chosen library work. That is left up to you.

:Type: ``string``
:Default: ``native``

Example::

    ADMINLTE2_DATETIME_WIDGET = 'jquery'
