Welcome to Django-AdminLTE2-PDQ's documentation!
************************************************

**Django-AdminLTE2-PDQ** is a `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ app
that takes all of the work out of making a beautiful and functional web
application pretty darn quickly (PDQ) using the
`AdminLTE2 <https://adminlte.io/themes/AdminLTE/index2.html>`_
theme.

Additionally, the app provides decorators, mixins, template filters, and
template tags to aid in the rapid development of a site.

* Easy sidebar menu creation.
* Automatic
  `Django Admin <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/>`_
  styling that matches AdminLTE2.
* Automatic inclusion of Admin links in the sidebar.
* Automatic menu link hiding based on user permissions to views.
* Template filters to aid in manual styling.
* Template tags for form rendering that matches AdminLTE2.
* Automatic form error and message styling.
* `Font Awesome 4 <https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/>`_
  & `Font Awesome 5 <https://fontawesome.com/v5/search>`_ integration.
* Highly configurable functionality, via project
  `Django settings variables <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/>`_.
